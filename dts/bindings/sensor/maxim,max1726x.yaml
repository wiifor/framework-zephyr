properties:
    design-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Battery Design Voltage in mV (3300 to 4400)

    desired-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Battery Desired Voltage in mV (3300 to 4400)

    desired-charging-current:
      type: int
      required: true

    design-cap:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Battery Capacity in mAh (default 3000)

    rsense-mohms:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 10
      description: Value of Rsense resistor in milliohms (e.g. 5). It cannot be 0

    empty-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Empty voltage target during load in mV (default 3300)

    recovery-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: The voltage level for clearing empty detection in mV (default 3880)

    charge-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Charge voltage in mV

    hibernate-threshold:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 7
      description: |
          Used to set the threshold level (in mA) for entering or exiting
          hibernate mode. The threshold is defined by the following equation:
          threshold (mA) = (FullCap(mAh)/0.8hrs)/2^(hibernate-threshold)
          Value must be betweew 0 and 15

    hibernate-scalar:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 4
      description: |
          Used to set the task period while in hibernate mode. The task perio is
          defined by the following equation:
          Task Period (s) = 351msx2^(hibernate-scalar)
          Value must be between 0 and 7

    hibernate-exit-time:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 3
      description: |
          Used to set the required time period of consecutive current readings
          above the hib-threshold value before the IC exits hibernate and return
          to active mode of operation. The exit time is defined by the following
          equation:
          Exit Time (s) = (hibernate-exit-time+1)x702msx2^(hibernate-scalar)
          Value must be between 0 and 3

    hibernate-enter-time:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
          Used to set the time period that consecutive current readings must
          remain below the hib-threshold value before the IC enters hibernate
          mode. The enter time is defined by the following equation:
          2.812sx2^(hibernate-enter-time)<Entry Time<2.812sx2^(hibernate-enter-time+1)
          Value must be between 0 and 7
